                    &diams;jQuery is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to create dynamic web pages. It helps in making web apps more efficient and interactive. It also helps to speed up the development process by providing a set of functions that can be used to manipulate data. It is a lightweight library that can be easily integrated into any website.

                <pre>
                    &diams; selector.css( PropertyName, PropertyValue );When animating addClass() and removeClass() jQuery adds a temporary style to the element, and then increments the appropriate values until they reach the values of the provided class, and only then does it actually add/remove the class.

                    Because of this I have to remove the style attribute, otherwise if the animation is stopped halfway the style attribute would remain and would permanently overwrite any class values, since style attributes in a tag have higher importance than class styles.
                    
                    However when the animation is halfway done it hasn't yet added the new class, and so with this solution the color jumps to the previous color when the user moves their mouse before the animation is completed.
