                <pre>
                    &diams;A bootstrap container is a handy class that generates a central region on the page where we can put our site content. The bootstrap .container has the advantage of being responsive and containing all of our other HTML code. Containers are used to pad the content within them, and there are two types of containers:

                    The .container class creates a fixed-width container that is responsive.
                    The .container-fluid class creates a full-width container that spans the entire viewport width.

            <pre>

                    &diams;The Bootstrap Grid System is a mobile-first, responsive grid system that scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size grows. Predefined classes for quick layout options and powerful mix-ins for creating successful semantic layouts are included in the system.

                    There are five classes in the Bootstrap 4 grid system:
                    
                    .col- for extra small devices, whose screen width is less than 576px.
                    .col-sm- small devices, whose screen width is equal to or greater than 576px.
                    .col-md- medium devices, whose screen width is equal to or greater than 768px.
                    .col-lg- large devices, whose screen width is equal to or greater than 992px.
                    .col-xl- extra large devices, whose screen width is equal to or greater than 1200px.
